	<H1><b>Goin' Fishin'</b></h1>
	<p>The first time I went fishing was with my father out on our lake. It was a beautiful sunny day and the lake was looking like something out of a movie. We rowed out to the middle and started to do some fishing. I did not know the first thing about fishing so I had to learn. My dad showed me how to hook the bait. I got the hang of that pretty fast. Then once we did that we moved on to casting a line. This was a little more difficult to get the hang of. He showed me how to do it. When he did it, it looked really easy. So I gave it a try, it was a lot harder than it looked. I kept releasing the line at the wrong time. After a couple tries I got the hang of it. I cast out my first successful line. I sat and waited for something to bit. I waited there for about two hours. Nothing bit. My dad said it was time to pack up out stuff and go home. He said I would have better luck the next day.   </p>
